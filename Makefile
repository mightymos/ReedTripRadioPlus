# Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Besides make, his project requires: 
#
# - sdcc
# - stcgal-patched
# - minicom
# - doxygen

# Usage ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Build executable in release mode:
#   make
#
# Build executable in debug mode:
#   make BUILD_MODE=debug
#
# Build documentation:
#   make doc
#
# Upload executable to MCU:
#   make upload
#
# Open serial console in new window:
#   make console
#
# Clean project (remove all build files):
#   make clean

# Target MCU settings --------------------------------------------------
# for STC15W101 and STC15W104 mcu used in door sensor
MCU_FREQ_KHZ := 24000
STACK_SIZE := 16

# limit code size to 1 KB to support '101 part
# (actually to 1017 bytes because unique id is stored at 0x3f9 as per sec. 1.12 global unique identification number STC15-English.pdf)
# take care to account for 7 bytes of unique id
# so for example is unique id is at locations 0x71 to 0x77 we can only use 113 bytes of ram
# alternative approach would be to use custom _sdcc_external_startup() sec. 4.1.4 mcs51 startup code in sdccman.pdf
